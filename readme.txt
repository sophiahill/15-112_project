Project Name: Poptropica: CMU Island

Description:
My term project is a game designed in the style of the game “Poptropica”, themed to Carnegie Mellon University. 
First, a 112 TA gives the player an introduction to the game. The first part of the game is a sidescroller
where the player walks past Gates until they reach a door. Once the player walks through the door, the player enters the 
second part of the game, the maze game. The maze has an enemy where the player loses if they touch, certain spots that 
transport the user to sub-mazes, and the player can view the backtracking path that the enemy follows. The player collects points in 
submazes and aims to get the most points possible. In the sub mazes, if the player touches an enemy points are deducted
from the score. The user wins once they get through three of the main mazes (the mazes increase in size every time the user
passes one).
